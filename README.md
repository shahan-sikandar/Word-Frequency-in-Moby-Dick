# Word-Frequency-in-Moby-Dick
Use web scraping and NLP to find the most frequent words in classic literature: Herman Melville's novel, Moby Dick.

In this project, you'll scrape a novel from an html file taken from the website Project Gutenberg (which contains a large corpus of books) using the Python requests package. Then you'll extract text from this web data using the BeautifulSoup library. Finally, you'll analyze the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (nltk), a very common NLP task used to gain insights on textual data and lay the groundwork for deeper analysis.
